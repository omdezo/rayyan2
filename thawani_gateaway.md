    ## Introduction
    Congratulation on considering Thawani Checkout as one of your Payment Service Providers. Thawani Checkout is a payment gateway that allows you to collect payments from your customers.

    Sending request to the proper endpoint server that is mentioned in the integration documentation.
    Redirect user to the provided payment link upon the successful generation of the link.

    Process user’s card payment or in-app payment.
    Send OTP through the user bank card’s phone number that is registered in the bank.
    Send payment result response bank.
    Once the integration is completed, a test entry will be made and we will print the receipt for checking and verification – to be signed be the merchant before sending the production API and public key.

    Important Notes
    The code sample is for demonstration purposes only. It should NOT be used as a base to develop the integration.
    Thawani does NOT supply any plugin for any eCommerce platform.
    All communication MUST be through emails ONLY.
    Please provide an email that will direct all automatic communications and notifications.
    Secret and Publishable keys are only for your company/organization purposes, NOT to be shared.
    We do our level best to serve as much merchants as possible from Sunday to Thursday between 9:00AM until 3:00PM and in working days only.
    ## Checklist
    In order to move your system to production environment, you need to meet the following requirements:

    - SSL Certificate.
    - Customer information passed on metadata (Name, Contact number, & Email address).
    - Payment display dialogue box should contain message that indicates accepts card payments

    ## Merchant Portal Configuration
    Before using the eCommerce, you must make sure that configuration in the Merchant portal is set properly. There are 3 main functions:
    - Integration Keys: generate integration keys (secret and publishable key)
    - Webhook URL: Set the webhook URL to receive the payment notification
    - Payment Methods: Set what payments can be received in Thawani Checkout.

    ## Secret and Publishable Keys

    You MUST provide Secret and Publishable Keys in order to call any request in Thawani Checkout. Each merchant will have his unique keys which he can generate from the merchant portal directly. For testing purposes, below is the keys that will help you while integrating. Note that this is in UAT ONLY. If you need to move to production, then contact A [Thawani Sales](mailto:sales@thawani.om "Thawani Sales") to register with Thawani as a merchant and get your own keys.

    `Secret Key: rRQ26GcsZzoEhbrP2HZvLYDbn9C9et`

    `Publishable Key: HGvTMLDssJghr9tlN9gr4DVYt0qyBy`

    ## Webhook verification
    ```javascript
    //These values are returned as part of header in webhook
    thawani-timestamp = 1733807121;
    thawani-signature = aa454c8f8170145b78f2747763f38aec44c91d1bb455558fdf78d76bde920747;


    function getHmacSignature(body, key) {
        const crypto = require('crypto');

        const textBytes = Buffer.from(body, 'ascii'); // or 'utf8' if needed
        const keyBytes = Buffer.from(key, 'ascii'); // or 'utf8' if needed

        const hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', keyBytes);

        hmac.update(textBytes);

        return hmac.digest('hex');
    }

    // Example usage
    const body = 'example_body_text';
    const key = 'example_secret_key'; //The webhook secret key set at portal.
    const signature = getHmacSignature(body + '-' + thawani-timestamp, key);
    console.log('HMAC Signature:', signature);
    ```

    Where the `body` will be the response body sent by webhook concatinated with `-`+`timestamp`. `timestamp` is part of the header.
    Verify the signature from the header with the generated one from above method.

    ## Webhook Data Samples
    Below is a sample documentation for a webhook bodies.
